# Project Brief: Startup Landing Page Template

## Purpose

This is a template designed for AI-assisted creation of startup and SaaS landing pages. Users will interact with an AI via chat to quickly generate customized, conversion-focused landing pages.

## Target Users

- Startup founders building product landing pages
- SaaS companies launching new products
- Developers using AI-assisted coding to rapidly prototype landing pages

## Core Use Case

Users describe their product/service to an AI assistant, which then customizes this template by:

1. Updating content in `src/lib/constants.ts`
2. Adjusting colors, typography, and styling
3. Adding/removing sections as needed
4. Customizing icons and imagery

## Key Requirements

### Must Have

- Modern, professional design that works for any SaaS/startup
- Fully responsive (mobile-first)
- All content centralized for easy AI modification
- Clear component structure for section-by-section customization
- No database required (static site)
- Fast performance

### Nice to Have

- Smooth scroll animations
- Dark mode support
- Additional section variants

## Success Metrics

- Time to customized landing page: < 10 minutes with AI
- Mobile Lighthouse score: > 90
- All sections easily customizable via constants file

## Constraints

- Pure frontend (no backend/database)
- Minimal dependencies
- Framework: Next.js 16 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS 4
